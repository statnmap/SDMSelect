Description: Select GAM, GLM models using a multiple k-fold
    cross-validation and map species distribution while accounting for
    model uncertainties.  Multiple family are possible and compared all
    together using RMSE or AUC as a result of cross-validation procedure.
    Covariates correlation may be tested.  The model selection procedure
    will test different combinations of covariates with LM, GLM, GLM
    natural splines and GAM models, with different distributions
    (Gaussian, Gamma, Log-Normal, Tweedie; Binomial) and with different
    maximum degrees of freedom for GLM with polynoms or natural splines.
    Calculations are parallelized when possible.  Outputs are numerous,
    allowing for summary of the model selection and the comparison of the
    different models all together. The final model selected is used to map
    species distribution along with maps of uncertainty.
