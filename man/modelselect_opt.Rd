Modelselect configuration file
}
\details{
The script is not a "everything is working fine by default" script.
Different options have to be defined along the script.
Users are advised to run the code by little parts to avoid any miss-specifications of parameters.
Different types of distribution are available as well as different criteria of selection.
Users are advised to verify if options match their dataset
\describe{
  \item{MPIcalc}{set to TRUE if you are running the functions on a MPI cluster}
  \item{nbclust}{number of cores to use. Default to all cores available.}
  \item{graph}{Show all figures during calculation process (Recommend FALSE)}
  \item{datatype}{data type. Default to ContPosNull. See below}
  \item{modeltypes}{All model types to compare depending on datatype.}
  \item{MaxDist}{Maximum distance for kriging (For datatype = KrigeGLM)}
  \item{Phi}{Vector of length 2 with min and max for fitting Phi (For datatype = KrigeGLM)}
  \item{Model}{Vector of length of modeltypes with variogram model as used with
 \code{\link[geoR]{cov.spatial}} (For datatype = KrigeGLM)}
  \item{lcc_proj}{Projection in meters. Default to Lambert93.(For datatype = KrigeGLM)}
  \item{Lambda}{Vector of length of modeltypes with lambda corresponding to
box-cox transformation (For datatype = KrigeGLM).}
  \item{fix.Lambda}{Vector of length of modeltypes with logical, whether to fix lambda
or let the model chose it (For datatype = KrigeGLM).}
  \item{Max_nb_Var}{Maximum number of covariates kept in a model}
  \item{Max_K Maximum}{degree of freedom for simple variables in GAM models.
Default Max_K=5 similar to Max_K_Poly=4}
  \item{Max_K_te}{Maximum degree of freedom for tensor interactions in GAM models}
  \item{Max_K_Poly}{Maximum degree of polynom for simple variables in GLM models}
  \item{fixXI}{0=chosen by model (time consuming), 1=Poisson, 2=Gamma, 1<FixXI<2 compound poisson
(For datatype = TweedGLM). See \code{\link[statmod]{tweedie}}}
  \item{Interaction}{Logical. Whether to test for covariates interactions in models.
A maximum of three interactions will be tested in the same model. This may be
highly time consuming. Should be FALSE with any "KrigeGLM*".}
  \item{MinNbModel}{minimum number of models kept at each iteration to avoid removing not to bad models}
  \item{k_fold Numeric}{Value k of the k-fold cross-validation}
  \item{N_k_fold}{Numeric Value N of the N times k-fold cross-validation}
  \item{nbMC}{N_k_fold * k_fold (for compatibility)}
  \item{seqthd}{Sequence of thresholds tested to cut between 0 and 1 for PA data.}
  \item{lim_pvalue}{p-value limit for models retained in each of the "modeltype"
  cross-validation stepwise approach.
  Procedure seek for models having ranks not
  significantly different (p>=lim_pvalue) than the best model .
  "lim_pvalue" can be small for each step to keep a little more models than necessary.
  If p-value is not significant, models are considered with similar power of prediction,
  and thus kept in the following iteration.
  The smallest the p-value, the less discriminant the test, thus the highest number
  of models retained}
  \item{lim_pvalue_final}{Similar to lim_pvalue but used to select best model
  among all models at the very end of the procedure. This value may be higher
  than lim_pvalue to be more discriminant. This allows to select the best model
  among all models that have been fitted after the different cross-validations}
  \item{Y.max}{value to which multiplying the maximum value of data observations.
  This is used as a maximum predicted value for uncertainty calculation
  with Tweedie model as calculation of too high values maybe very long.
  This also fixes the maximum prediction for species distribution mapping when
  the model has a high uncertainty for sparse positions and lead to impossibly
  too high values.}
  \item{seed}{Numeric Seed for random number generation (Allow reproducibility
   between simulations)}
  \item{seqthd}{This allows to choose the best threshold value to predict
  presence-absence with probability of presence.
Balance between 0 and 1 in data may deviate the best threshold from value 0.5.
The best threshold is calculated among all cross-validations.
Threshold value chosen is the one the closest to specificity = sensitivity.}

\describe{
  \item{PA}{Presence-Absence data (=binomial distribution)}
  \item{Cont}{Continuous data. Positive and/or negative. (=gaussian distribution)}
  \item{ContPosNull}{Continuous but positive (or null) data like Biomass/Density data.
  For data with zero values,
  modeltypes allowing only positive values can also be tested (LogNormal, Gamma).
  In that case, a box-cox transformation will be applied: model is fitted on
  `log(X+1)`, but cross-validation compares `pred(Y)-1`, which is in the scale
  of the data. This allows comparison with Gaussian distribution.
  (=gaussian distribution; modeltypes are Gaussian, Gamma, Lognormal and Tweedie)}
  \item{Count}{model of Count data (=Poisson model)}
  \item{PosCount}{Poisson model on positive data (Difference with Count in goodness of fit)}
  \item{TweedGLM}{Tweedie distribution (only GLM)}
  \item{KrigeGLM}{Co-kriging model with gaussian distribution. Experimental -
  Equation of variogram have to be tested separately before any run with this script,
  verify that \code{\link{modelselect_opt}} is correctly set up:
  Default values are not safe at all !}
}

modeltypes are types of model tested:
GLM, GLM with natural splines (GLMns), GAM.
If there is no "GLM" in the name of the modeltype,
then GAM is fitted with library mgcv.
